The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that may be null or undefined, leading to a runtime error (TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference).  This is a common issue, but the specific way it manifests in complex code can be difficult to track down.

```actionscript
public class MyClass {
    public var myObject:MyOtherClass;
    public function MyClass() {
        // myObject might not be initialized here
    }

    public function myMethod():void {
        //Error prone line: accessing a property before checking for null
        var value:String = myObject.someProperty;
        trace(value);
    }
}
```

The problem lies in the `myMethod` function.  If `myObject` is null, accessing `myObject.someProperty` will throw the #1009 error.  This can occur if `myObject` isn't properly initialized before the `myMethod` call.
