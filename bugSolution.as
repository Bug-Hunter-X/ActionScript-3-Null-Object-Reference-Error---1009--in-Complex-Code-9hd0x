The solution is to add a null check before accessing `myObject.someProperty`.  Here's the corrected code:

```actionscript
public class MyClass {
    public var myObject:MyOtherClass;
    public function MyClass() {
        // myObject might not be initialized here
    }

    public function myMethod():void {
        //Corrected code: Check if myObject is null before accessing
        if (myObject != null) {
            var value:String = myObject.someProperty;
            trace(value);
        } else {
            trace("myObject is null");
        }
    }
}
```

This version first checks if `myObject` is null. If it is, it handles the situation gracefully (in this case by tracing a message). If `myObject` is not null, then the property access is safe.
